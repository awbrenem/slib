; Function: sdatarate.
; Purpose: Get data rate of a time series.
; Parameters:
;   t0s, in, dblarr(n), req. Time series in sec (e.g., unix time).
; Keywords: none.
; Return: out, double. Data rate in sec.
; Notes: The input time series needs to be quasi-uniform, but can has gaps.
; Dependence: slib.
; History:
;   2012-09-28, Sheng Tian, create.
